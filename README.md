Hello! This is my Book Manager project! â™¡

- I love reading and wanted to create a side project that I would personally use.
- It is a great way to keep track of books you want to read, books you've read, liked, hated, reviews you've left on books, etc!
- I learned how to create my own full stack project

## Step-by-step installation guide

2. Open the application.properties file (or any configuration file for database connection) and configure the database connection properties (e.g., URL, username, password) to connect to your PostgreSQL database (Books).
3. Run the java server (BookappApplication)

Step 3: Setting up the Client Server:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the client/server code in your terminal.
2. Install dependencies by running 'npm install'.
